# Flutter Web Codelab (pt. 3) - Flutter Web Apps / Animations

## Overview

Welcome aboard! Join me on part 3 of the Flutter Web Series of Codelabs. If you've come from the previous codelabs - great job in making it this far. If not, here's [part 1](https://romanejaquez.github.io/flutterweb-codelab-portfolio1) and [part 2](https://romanejaquez.github.io/flutterweb-codelab-portfolio2) for you to catch up.


### NOTE: THIS IS NOT A BEGINNER CODELAB

(If you're looking for more beginner content, please visit some of my other codelabs [here](https://romanjustcodes.web.app/#/workshops)). If you're up for the challenge, then proceed.

In Part 3, you will spruce up your Flutter Web app by implementing animations, elevating your web app and adding some flare! In this codelab you'll learn the following:

- Animations in Flutter: Implicit & Explicit Animations
- Using the **flutter_animate** package to implement explicit animations in an easy way
- Implement page transitions by tapping into the animated transition capabilities of the **GoRouter** page
- Importing more advanced and complex animations using the **Rive** runtime
